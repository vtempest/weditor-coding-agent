# wZed

A [Zed](https://zed.dev)-inspired playground for [Nodepod](https://github.com/ScelarOrg/Nodepod) — the browser-native Node.js runtime. Features split panes, an integrated terminal running real Node.js in the browser, Monaco code editing, git integration, AI assistant, and live preview — all without a backend.

> **Experimental:** Both wZed and [Nodepod](https://github.com/ScelarOrg/Nodepod) are in early development. Expect bugs, missing features, and breaking changes.

> **Disclaimer:** wZed is not affiliated with [Zed Industries](https://zed.dev). This is an independent playground with a Zed-inspired design, built as a frontend for [Nodepod](https://github.com/ScelarOrg/Nodepod).

- File finder (`Ctrl+P`)
- Global text search across project files
- Customizable keybindings (VSCode, JetBrains, Vim presets)

## Getting Started

### Install and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ScelarOrg/wZed.git weditor
cd weditor
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Extensions & Marketplace

wZed supports real Zed extensions with a built-in marketplace! See [ZED_EXTENSIONS.md](ZED_EXTENSIONS.md) for documentation.

**Browse the marketplace:**
1. Open the Marketplace panel (Shopping Bag icon in status bar)
2. Search from hundreds of real Zed extensions
3. Install themes, languages, and tools with one click

**Try the example extension:**
1. Copy `example-extension/` to your project at `/project/.weditor/extensions/`
2. Open the Extensions panel (Package icon in status bar)
3. Enable the extension and use `Ctrl+Shift+U` to convert text to uppercase

> **Note:** SharedArrayBuffer is required for the nodepod runtime. The Next.js config sets the necessary COEP/COOP headers automatically.

### Git integration

To use push/pull with GitHub, set a personal access token in **Settings > Git > GitHub Token**. The token is stored locally in your browser and never sent to any server.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start Next.js dev server (localhost:3000) |
| `npm run build` | Production build (static export) |
| `npm run start` | Serve production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

## How It Works

1. **Boot** — The app dynamically imports Nodepod and creates an in-memory Node.js environment with a virtual filesystem at `/project`.
2. **Edit** — Files are read/written through Nodepod's async fs API. Monaco renders with language detection and theme-matched colors.
3. **Run** — Terminal commands spawn worker-based processes. Output streams back in real time. HTTP servers register in Nodepod's server registry.
4. **Preview** — When a server starts on a port, the browser panel navigates to it. Requests are intercepted and dispatched through Nodepod's HTTP polyfill.

## Project Templates

When creating a new project, choose from:

- **Blank** — Empty workspace
- **React** — Vite + React starter
- **Node.js** — HTTP server example
- **Vite** — Vanilla JS with Vite

Each template comes with starter files and an optional auto-run command.
